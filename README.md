# ｄｅｂｉａｎ－ｈｅｌｐｅｒｓ🐧
Random (but useful) Debian scripts and utilities to save your time and your sanity.

* [iptables-noddosplz](https://github.com/nano11bravo/debian-helpers/blob/main/iptables-noddosplz) - Stupid simple iptables modification to aid in the protection of a host from DDOS attacks and/or other sorts of malicious activities.

## 【 🔥 Ｄｉｓｃｌａｉｍｅｒ💥】
* If you brick your router/modem/device using any of the iptables scripts please do not come to me for reimbursement. Although these are for debian systems they have not been tested with [OpenWRT](https://openwrt.org/docs/start)/etc.
* Please refer to the above if your network rack catches fire. Thank you.
